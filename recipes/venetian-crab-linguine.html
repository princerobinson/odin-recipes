        <h3>Crab linguine is a traditional Venetian dish comprised largely of linguine and chunks of crab meat. With just a few good quality ingredients, this crab pasta is bursting with flavour and very easy to make at home.</h3>
        <p>Ingredients</p>
            <ul>
                <li>300 g good quality dried linguine (10.5oz)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 large clove garlic, crushed</li>
                <li>½ cup dry white wine (125ml)</li>
                <li>1 cup cherry tomatoes, chopped in half</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon cream (optional) </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sea salt flakes</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon freshly cracked pepper</li>
                <li>¾ cup cooked crab meat</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Steps</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Place a saucepan of salted water over high heat and bring to the boil, then add your pasta.</li>
                <li>Place the oil and garlic to a frying pan over medium heat, stirring. Once the oil is hot, saute the garlic for about 1 minute but don’t let it get too dark.</li>
                <li>Add the wine and turn the heat up to high. Let it bubble away for 2-3 minutes until the wine has almost totally evaporated. </li>
                <li>Add the cherry tomatoes and saute for about 2 minutes, then add the salt and pepper.  </li>
                <li>Add 1/2 a cup of the pasta water followed by the cream and give it a good stir. Add the crab and stir until heated through (only about 30 seconds). </li>
                <li>By now the pasta should be al dente, so drain the water away and add the pasta to the sauce. Give it all a good mix, check the seasoning and serve.</li>
