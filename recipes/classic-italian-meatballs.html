        <p>Ingredients</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 pounds ground beef, 80% to 90% lean meat</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup breadcrumbs, plain or Italian-style</li>
                <li>½ cup parmesan cheese, freshly grated, plus more for garnish</li>
                <li>½ cup yellow onion, finely minced</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasonings, omit if using Italian-style breadcrumbs</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
                <li>¼ cup sliced basil, for garnish</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Steps</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Set the oven rack to the lower-middle position and set it to broil. Line a large baking sheet with foil and lightly grease it with olive oil. Set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, add the ground beef, eggs, breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, minced onion, salt, black pepper, Italian seasoning, and minced garlic. Use hands to mix thoroughly until combined.</li>
                <li>Measure and roll the ground beef mixture into ⅓ cup (3 ounces) rounds, about the size of an egg. Evenly space the pieces on the baking sheet, there should be about 14 to 15 meatballs.</li>
                <li>Broil the meatballs until the surface is browned, about 10 to 12 minutes. Turn over and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes to lightly brown the other side.</li>
                <li>Transfer the meatballs to the tomato sauce. Cover the pot with the lid slightly ajar, simmer on low heat for at least 1 ½ hours, checking and stirring every 20 minutes, or as needed. The meatballs should be fork tender when sliced. </li>
                <li>At the end of cooking, adjust the consistency of the sauce with water if needed, about 1 tablespoon at a time. Season to taste with salt and pepper. </li>
                <li>Serve meatballs with spaghetti topped with sauce, sliced basil, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
            </ol>
