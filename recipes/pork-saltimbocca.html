        <h3>Pork Saltimbocca is a pork lovers riff on the famous Italian dish, traditionally made with veal. It's hard to believe, but this restaurant worthy dish is made in just 30 minutes. </h3>
        <p>Ingredients</p>
            <ul>
                <li>4 6-ounce boneless center-cut pork loin chops ¾-inch thick</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt plus more for seasoning meat</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper plus more for seasoning meat</li>
                <li>4 thin lemon slices</li>
                <li>5 large fresh sage leaves divided</li>
                <li>4 slices prosciutto large enough to wrap around pork chops</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
                <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
                <li>14 ½ ounce can diced tomatoes drained</li>
                <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Steps</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pat dry each pork chop and season lightly with salt and pepper on both sides. Place one slice of lemon and one fresh sage leaf on each pork chop. Wrap each pork chop crosswise with a slice of prosciutto, pressing to seal.</li>
                <li>Finely chop remaining sage leaf.</li>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place pork chops, lemon side up in the hot oil; cook 6 minutes. (Reduce heat if prosciutto is browning too quickly) Carefully turn pork chops over with tongs or a thin metal spatula and cook 2 to 3 minutes more, until an instant read thermometer inserted in the center reads 145˚F and prosciutto has caramelized. Remove from skillet and tent with foil to keep warm.</li>
                <li>Add white wine to skillet; cook and stir with a wooden spoon, scraping up any brown bits. Add chicken broth and boil until reduced by half, 4 to 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, cream, 1 teaspoon kosher salt and ¼ teaspoon of pepper; cook and stir until thickened and bubbly, about 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Arrange pork chops on serving platter or place one on each of 4 dinner plates; spoon sauce over each chop and garnish with finely chopped sage; serve immediately.</li>
