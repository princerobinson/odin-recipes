        <p>Ingredients</p>
            <ul>
                <li>20 ounces whole, white mushrooms (or small portobellos)</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>2 plum tomatoes, peeled (used canned or fresh)</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>⅛ teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>1 ½ teaspoons fresh, snipped parsley</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Steps</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse the mushrooms under a light stream of cool water while using a brush to clean off the dirt. (Or use a damp paper towel to wipe off the dirt.) Dry the mushrooms with paper towels.</li>
                <li>Cut off the hard edge of each stem and slice the mushrooms ½-inch thick.</li>
                <li>Peel the garlic. Slice it thinly or chop it. (Don't chop it too finely, or it will burn.)</li>
                <li>Heat the oil in a 12-inch frying pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for a minute, being careful not to let it burn.</li>
                <li>Add the mushroom slices and stir them briefly to coat with the olive oil and garlic. Let the mushrooms cook in an even layer over medium-high heat, uncovered, sitrring occasionally. When they release their liquid, turn the heat higher. Cook until all the liquid is evaporated. It could take about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>While the mushrooms are cooking, cut up the tomatoes and drain them using a fine-mesh strainer. Make sure there is no tomato juice left, or it will make the mushrooms soggy. Rinse the parsley and snip it until you have 1 ½ teaspoons.</li>
                <li>When the liquid has evaporated from the pan of mushrooms, push the mushrooms to the sides to make space in the center of the pan. Add the tomatoes to the middle of the pan. Let the tomatoes cook for five minutes, stirring as needed.</li>
                <li>Add the salt, pepper and parsley. Stir everything to combine. Turn off the heat.</li>
                <li>Serve the mushrooms and store any leftovers for up to five days in the refrigerator. Do not freeze them.</li>
            </ol>
