        <p>Ingredients</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 Roasted Eggplant</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons golden raisins</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons sherry vinegar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons capers</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>½ medium yellow onion, chopped</li>
                <li>1 celery stalk, diced</li>
                <li>1 red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and diced</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon sea salt</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
                <li>3 garlic cloves, grated</li>
                <li>1 pound tomatoes, about 4 medium, cored and diced</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon cane sugar</li>
                <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
                <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>Fresh basil leaves, for garnish</li>
                <li>Crostini, for serving</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Steps</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In a small bowl, combine the golden raisins, vinegar, and capers. Set aside for the raisins to soften while you prepare the caponata.</li>
                <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and celery and cook for 8 minutes, or until the vegetables have softened. Add the red pepper and salt. Cook until tender, about 8 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the tomato paste, garlic, tomatoes, and sugar, and cook, stirring often, for about 8 minutes, or until the tomatoes have cooked down and become saucy.</li>
                <li>Add the roasted eggplant, raisins, vinegar, capers, and several grinds of pepper, and cook, stirring, for 5 more minutes. Stir in the parsley and season to taste.</li>
                <li>Allow the caponata to cool to room temperature. We like it best on days 2 and 3, after the flavors have had a chance to meld. Store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
                <li>When ready to serve, garnish the caponata with fresh basil. Serve with crostini.</li>
            </ol>
