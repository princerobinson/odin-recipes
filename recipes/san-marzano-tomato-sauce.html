        <h3>My beloved San Marzano Tomato Sauce. This luscious red sauce is simmered for several hours to develop the richest taste. It’s filled with fresh herbs, authentic Italian flavors, and the most inviting aroma. Easily the best tomato sauce I’ve ever had! From my family to yours. </h3>
        <p>Ingredients</p>
            <ul>
                <li>8 cloves minced garlic</li>
                <li>2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>4-5 28oz cans San Marzano Peeled Tomatoes (with juices)</li>
                <li>2-3 tbsp amore sun-dried tomato paste (or use regular tomato paste)</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp (each) salt & black pepper</li>
                <li>3 Tbsp fresh basil (for dried basil – 1 Tbsp)</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp fresh oregano (for dried oregano – 2 tsp)</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Steps</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook garlic: In a large stainless steel pot on LOW-MEDIUM heat sauté garlic in olive oil for 30-60 seconds. Stir constantly to keep garlic from burning. </li>
                <li>Add tomatoes and simmer: pour canned tomatoes with juices in with the garlic. Add tomato paste, salt, and black pepper. Mix ingredients together, partially cover with lid – but not completely, and simmer on LOW heat for 3+ hours. Stir every so often to avoid burning. Note: if using a parmesan rind, add it in this step and let it simmer with sauce until finished. Remove and discard rind when ready to serve. </li>
                <li>For smooth sauce: when sauce is finished cooking, use a hand immersion-blender to puree. Note: If you prefer a chunkier/thicker sauce (like I do), you can skip this step as the San Marzanos naturally break down while cooking. </li>
                <li>Add herbs: when sauce is finished, mix in chopped fresh herbs. Season with additional salt & black pepper if needed and serve! </li>
            </ol>
