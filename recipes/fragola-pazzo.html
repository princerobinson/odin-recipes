        <h3> This is an Italian dessert that goes great with pasta. As the name suggests, it's a crazy combination but surprisingly excellent. Someone always asks me for the recipe when I make it. Be sure to use a good quality balsamic vinegar with this dish or you will not have as good results.</h3>
